    "Hard links let the user create additional paths to access another node in the same file, and once created, they are indistinguishable from the referred node object, except that they have different paths in the object tree. For example, if the referred node is, say, a Table object, then the new hard link will become a Table object itself. From this point on, you will be able to access the same Table object from two different paths: the original one and the new hard link path. If you delete one path to the table, you will be able to reach it via the other path.\n",
